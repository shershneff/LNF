Sergey Gimelshein is an eminent scientist, actively working in the field
of mathematical modeling, molecular gas dynamics, and physics of non-equilibrium
and rarefied gas flows. He made important contributions to the development
of numerical methods of non-equilibrium gas dynamics and their applications
to academic and applied problems. He and his team obtained important results
in computational fluid dynamic and hypersonic aerodynamics, statistical
simulation of rarefied and near-continuum gas flows with real gas effects,
kinetic models and numerical algorithms for modeling non-equilibrium chemical
processes, laminar separated flows, shock wave reflection phenomena, two-phase
flows, laser-matter interaction, plume interactions and satellite surface
contamination, as well conventional, micro-, and electric propulsion.
The list of Sergey Gimelshein's publications consists of more than 200 papers 
(27 publications in peer-reviewed journals for the last five years).
