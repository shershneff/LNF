Comprehensive study of a number of important research problems is necessary 
for the development of new generations of space vehicles, such as high-performance 
launchers, re-entry vehicles, small satellites, and interplanetary spacecraft, 
to make giant leaps forward. One of the key problems that needs to be addressed 
is to provide qualitatively better understanding of non-equilibrium flows, and 
thus drastically improve capabilities available to engineers and scientists for 
the prediction and analysis of such flows. This problem can be tackled only
through the combined theoretical, numerical, and experimental research that 
involves essentially new level of theoretical description and mathematical 
modeling, the use of the full power of modern computers, improvement of 
experimental techniques, and application of new diagnostic tools, which 
will provide much greater detail of the examined flow. Achieving a true 
synergy of theory, modeling, and experiment, that through the fundamental 
knowledge becomes basis for new breakthrough space technologies, is the main 
goal of the Laboratory of Non-Equilibrium Flows and Aerothermodynamics of Space 
Vehicles, established on the basis of the Novosibirsk State University. 
The Laboratory is headed by `Sergey Gimelshein <gimelshein.html>`_, 
an Astronautics Professor of the University of Southern California (USA). 

The Laboratory unites professionally active researchers from the Novosibirsk State 
University (NSU) and two laboratories, Computational Aerodynamics Laboratory and Laboratory 
of Physical Problems of Gas-Dynamic Flow Control, of the Khristianovich Institute of 
Theoretical and Applied Mechanics of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of 
Sciences (ITAM SB RAS). The Institute has an established, long-term collaboration 
with NSU through the Chair of Aerophysics and Gas Dynamics of the Physical Department 
of NSU, which will greatly facilitate the unification. The formation of such a laboratory 
will allow us to organize high quality, world recognized research in the fields that form 
the basis of the modern and prospective space engineering, as well as provide an opportunity 
for professional training of specialists for the Russian space industry, who will be able 
to learn and use the most advanced computational and experimental methods.
