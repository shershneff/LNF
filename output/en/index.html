<p>Comprehensive study of a number of important research problems is necessary
for the development of new generations of space vehicles, such as high-performance
launchers, re-entry vehicles, small satellites, and interplanetary spacecraft,
to make giant leaps forward. One of the key problems that needs to be addressed
is to provide qualitatively better understanding of non-equilibrium flows, and
thus drastically improve capabilities available to engineers and scientists for
the prediction and analysis of such flows. This problem can be tackled only
through the combined theoretical, numerical, and experimental research that
involves essentially new level of theoretical description and mathematical
modeling, the use of the full power of modern computers, improvement of
experimental techniques, and application of new diagnostic tools, which
will provide much greater detail of the examined flow. Achieving a true
synergy of theory, modeling, and experiment, that through the fundamental
knowledge becomes basis for new breakthrough space technologies, is the main
goal of the Laboratory of Non-Equilibrium Flows and Aerothermodynamics of Space
Vehicles, established on the basis of the Novosibirsk State University.
The Laboratory is headed by <a class="reference external" href="gimelshein.html">Sergey Gimelshein</a>,
an Astronautics Professor of the University of Southern California (USA).</p>
<p>The Laboratory unites professionally active researchers from the Novosibirsk State
University (NSU) and two laboratories, Computational Aerodynamics Laboratory and Laboratory
of Physical Problems of Gas-Dynamic Flow Control, of the Khristianovich Institute of
Theoretical and Applied Mechanics of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of
Sciences (ITAM SB RAS). The Institute has an established, long-term collaboration
with NSU through the Chair of Aerophysics and Gas Dynamics of the Physical Department
of NSU, which will greatly facilitate the unification. The formation of such a laboratory
will allow us to organize high quality, world recognized research in the fields that form
the basis of the modern and prospective space engineering, as well as provide an opportunity
for professional training of specialists for the Russian space industry, who will be able
to learn and use the most advanced computational and experimental methods.</p>
