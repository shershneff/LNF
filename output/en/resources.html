<p><strong>SMILE software system</strong></p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="smile.html">SMILE</a> software system  is designed for solving non-equilibrium
rarefied gas dynamics problems on multiprocessor computers. The system includes a
preprocessor module for defining a geometric model of the vehicle and specifying boundary and initial conditions, and a postprocessor
module, providing analysis and visualization of the results of simulations.</p>

<p><strong>Hypersonic impulse wind tunnel IT-302M</strong></p>
<p>This unique hypersonic facility allows us to perform experiments at Mach numbers M = 5รท12 and stagnation
temperatures up to 3000-4000K, i. e. at conditions close to the real flight. This is indispensable in studies aimed at developing advanced
aerospace technologies. Conventional supersonic wind tunnels cannot provide the necessary values of the Reynolds number and the
stagnation temperature because of high thermal loads in the wind tunnel channel. In impulse wind tunnels due to the short running time
there is an opportunity to invest, by electric discharge, adiabatic compression and combustion reaction, significantly more extra energy in
the working gas. For planned experiments the IT-302M wind tunnel will be substantially upgraded. Research will include the schlieren
visualization of density gradient field recorded with high-speed camera, measuring the pressure and heat flux fluctuations on the model
surface with piezoceramic sensors, atomic-layer thermocouples and high-speed panoramic IR camera.</p>

<p><strong>Supersonic tunnel T-327B</strong></p>
<p>The supersonic wind tunnel T-327B is a small-size aerodynamic facility. At this facility, experimental research on control of the
aerodynamic characteristics of reentry vehicles with gas-permeable porous materials will be undertaken. Mesh screens and cellular-porous
materials with different spatial structure and porosity will be used as gas-permeable materials. For the first time experiments on the effect
of temperature and temperature distribution in a gas-permeable material on the aerodynamic characteristics of the models will be carried
out. The necessary temperature fields in gas-permeable materials supposed to be created by a distributed ohmic heating of the gas
permeable material. First experiments will also be held to change the temperature of the gas in the pores of cellular-porous materials with
an electric discharge. In combination with ohmic heating it allows you to control the flow viscosity in porous materials for the formation
of an effective shape of the frontal part of the body in order to create controlled aerodynamic moments.</p>

<p><strong>Low-noise supersonic wind tunnel T-325</strong></p>
<p>The T-325 is a low-noise wind tunnel. It operates at Mach numbers up to 4. The turbulence level in the working section of the wind tunnel
is less than a tenth of a percent, which makes it unique for studies of the laminar-turbulent transition at moderate supersonic speeds. The
T-325 will be also used for the experiments on boundary layer control.</p>

<p><strong>Gas dynamic facility LEMPUS</strong></p>
<p>A series of experiments will be carried out on the gas-dynamic complex LEMPUS, providing the flow Mach number up to 20. Gas
composition at the nozzle exit will be measured by gas chromatography mass spectrometry. This facility will also be used for investigation
of processes of hydrocarbon synthesis in plasma chemical reactions. The low-density experimental complex of Department of Applied
Physics, Research Sector of Novosibirsk State University include the LEMPUS-1 and LEMPUS-2 gas dynamic facilities and a plasma
chemical facility equipped with turbo-molecular and cryogenic pumps, electron guns, modern quadrupole and TOF mass-spectrometers,
molecular beam generators, monochromators, liquid nitrogen station, thermostats, computer-aided systems of control and data acquisition.
The facility can operate in stationary as well as pulse regimes. The pulse regimes provide a significant extension of the range of gas
densities and mass rates and allow us to form non-equilibrium rarefied gas flows.</p>
