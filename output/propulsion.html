    <h3>Propulsion technologies</h3>
    
    <p>Recent trends in the space community for smaller, cheaper and more frequent space
missions have driven the development of micro- and nanosatellites. The use of small
spacecraft constellations is an attempt to enhance the overall performance of
communication and remote sensing tasks currently done by a relatively small number
of large platforms. Because micro-technologies have the advantage of reducing the
total resources required on a spacecraft, the continued development of micro-technologies
for space applications will further enable small satellite missions. Nanosatellites
(mass between 1 and 10 kg) impose significant limitations on mass, power and volume
available for all subsystems including propulsion. In recent years, micropropulsion
systems have been developed to address this need. A wide array of concepts will
require the expansion of propellant gases through microscale nozzles. Because
many micropropulsion systems will also operate at relatively low pressures, the
investigation of low-Reynolds-number nozzle and jet flows has become increasingly
important for realistic evaluation of new concepts.</p>
<p>When in orbit, spacecraft require on-board or secondary propulsion systems to perform
orbit transfer, orbit maintenance, and attitude control maneuvers. An important
issue in the use of any spacecraft propulsion system involves the assessment and
reduction of effects caused by the interaction between the thruster plume and
spacecraft surfaces. Direct impingement of a thruster plume on surfaces can generate
unwanted torques, localized surface heating, and surface contamination. Self-impingement
(i.e. the impingement of a thruster plume on a host satellite surface) generally
occurs for small surface angles with respect to the propulsion system’s thrust
vector or occurs in the thruster back flow. Cross impingement (i.e. the impingement
of one spacecraft’s thruster plume onto another spacecraft) can occur at essentially
any angle and is becoming increasingly important with the advent of microsatellite
constellations. Although there have been few reported incidents of spacecraft
failing because of spacecraft interaction effects from the secondary propulsion
system, the tighter margins of contemporary spacecraft operation require improved
optimization of all spacecraft systems. Improved assessment of the interaction
potential of a thruster may also allow propulsion systems on spacecraft that are
extremely sensitive to contamination concerns. Accurate prediction of plume interaction
effects is technically challenging. It is very difficult and expensive to recreate
the in-orbit environment within a ground-based laboratory facility. In terms of
modeling, the flow physics associated with chemical and plasma propulsion systems
is complex, requiring the development of advanced numerical techniques. In the past,
due to the lack of detailed information, the prevention of the plume effects described
here has been achieved primarily using very conservative spacecraft design. In the
past few years, significant advances have been made in terms of both experimental
facilities and numerical methods for the measurement and computation of the plumes
of spacecraft secondary propulsion systems.</p>
<p>Therefore, this is an appropriate time to consider advancing the current state-of-the-art
in numerical modeling for this important area of spacecraft design. This proposal
seeks to address spacecraft-thruster interaction issues for both chemical and
electric propulsion systems. As new thruster technologies are developed, investigations
of spacecraft-thruster interactions will continue, and as new spacecraft technologies
are developed, these studies will become increasingly important. The present project
will involve numerical studies of exhaustion of gas jets of real spacecraft thrusters
into vacuum. Such studies are necessary to estimate contamination and the action
of these jets both on the spacecraft itself and on another spacecraft during orbital
docking and undocking. Jet exhaustion occurs in a rapidly changing sequence of flow
regimes: from continuum (inside the nozzle) through transitional (near the nozzle
exit) to free-molecular (at a large distance from the nozzle exit). The flow is
usually in an essentially non-equilibrium state. Numerical investigations will be
performed by using two approaches: solving the Navier-Stokes equations inside the
nozzle and using the DSMC method outside the nozzle. As the jet is sufficiently
dense near the nozzle exit, the DSMC requires significant computational resources
(memory and speed). Therefore, it is necessary to use massive parallel computers
and a multizone approach where the results of computations in a certain domain
around the nozzle are used as the boundary conditions for computations in a greater
domain. The flow generated by interaction of several jets will be simulated. Efforts
will be put into development of an approximate analytical model which will allow
for determination of plume far field parameters using nozzle exit data and to assess
the contamination of the spacecraft/satellite surface.</p>
<p>An alternative concept that can be used to fulfill on-orbit propulsion tasks (such
as orientation and orbit correction) are electric thrusters. Their basic advantage
over thermochemical control engines is a higher jet exhaustion velocity and,
correspondingly, a lower flow rate of the working gas at an identical thrust
(i.e., a higher specific impulse). One of the major problems of using these engines
is the interaction of the plasma jet from the engine with the surfaces of solar
arrays, radiators, and other sensitive elements of the space vehicle. A typical
feature of the jets of such engines is an extremely high degree of thermal
non-equilibrium of the flow, which necessitates the use of the kinetic approach
based on the particle-in-cell/DSMC technique. Problems of exhaustion of jets from
such engines into the space and interaction of these jets with the vehicle surface
will be considered within the framework of this project. In particular, the PIC
module for treating the charged particles will be implemented into the proposed
DSMC GPU code. A state-of-the-art hydrodynamic model will be employed to simulate
electrons while ions will be treated as particles in the conventional
particle-in-cell/DSMC fashion. Modeling of the electric thruster plumes and their
interaction with a 3D satellite/spacecraft models will be performed in order to
assess possible impairment of communication systems, scientific instrumentations
and solar arrays. A computational tool for prediction of electric thruster plume/satellite
interaction will be developed as a deliverable in the framework of the proposed
project. Special attention will be paid to validation of the physical and chemical
models of the electric thruster plumes against ground-based experiments.</p>
